## Minor

* Modified title of package from 'Computational Modelling' to 'Computational Modeling' to conform with US spelling
* Recoded diagnostics, making the code more efficent.
* Correcting some typos and code aesthetics (e.g., replaced print with cat to display running time of analyses)

# bfw 0.0.1

* Initial launch with the following modules:
    + Bernoulli trials
    + Covariate estimations (including correlation and Cronbach's alpha)
    + Fit data (e.g., SEM, CFA, mediation models)
    + Bayesian equivalent of Cohen's kappa
    + Mean and standard deviation estimations
    + Predict metric values (cf., ANOVA)
    + Predict nominal values (c.f., chi-square test)
    + Simple, multiple and hierarchical regression
    + Softmax regression (i.e., multinomial logistic regression)
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added a `TODO.md` file to track future work on the package.
